// If passing function in options, then use it for resolve "head" element.

// Useful for Shadow Root style i.e

// {

//   insertInto: function () { return document.querySelector("#foo").shadowRoot }

// }

// Special case to return head of iframe instead of iframe itself

// This will throw an exception if access to iframe is blocked

// due to cross-origin restrictions

// If a transform function was defined, run it on the css

// If the transform function returns a falsy value, don't add this css.

// This allows conditional loading of css

// noop

// If transform returns a value, use that instead of the original css.

// This allows running runtime transformations on the css.

// By default, add <style> tags to the <head> element

// By default, add <style> tags to the bottom of the target

// If outerFn provided and outerFn.prototype is a Generator, then outerFn.prototype instanceof Generator.

// The ._invoke method unifies the implementations of the .next,

// .throw, and .return methods.

// Be forgiving, per 25.3.3.3.3 of the spec:

// https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-generatorresume

// Setting context._sent for legacy support of Babel's

// function.sent implementation.

// If an exception is thrown from innerFn, we leave state ===

// GenStateExecuting and loop back for another invocation.

// Dispatch the exception by looping back around to the

// context.dispatchException(context.arg) call above.

// Call delegate.iterator[context.method](context.arg) and handle the

// result, either by returning a { value, done } result from the

// delegate iterator, or by modifying context.method and context.arg,

// setting context.delegate to null, and returning the ContinueSentinel.

// Try/catch helper to minimize deoptimizations. Returns a completion

// record like context.tryEntries[i].completion. This interface could

// have been (and was previously) designed to take a closure to be

// invoked without arguments, but in all the cases we care about we

// already have an existing method we want to call, so there's no need

// to create a new function object. We can even get away with assuming

// the method takes exactly one argument, since that happens to be true

// in every case, so we don't have to touch the arguments object. The

// only additional allocation required is the completion record, which

// has a stable shape and so hopefully should be cheap to allocate.

// Dummy constructor functions that we use as the .constructor and

// .constructor.prototype properties for functions that return Generator

// objects. For full spec compliance, you may wish to configure your

// minifier not to mangle the names of these two functions.

// This is a polyfill for %IteratorPrototype% for environments that

// don't natively support it.

// This environment has a native %IteratorPrototype%; use it instead

// of the polyfill.

// Helper for defining the .next, .throw, and .return methods of the

// Iterator interface in terms of a single ._invoke method.

// Define the unified helper method that is used to implement .next,

// .throw, and .return (see defineIteratorMethods).

// When a yielded Promise is resolved, its final value becomes

// the .value of the Promise<{value,done}> result for the

// current iteration.

// If a rejected Promise was yielded, throw the rejection back

// into the async generator function so it can be handled there.

// If enqueue has been called before, then we want to wait until

// all previous Promises have been resolved before calling invoke,

// so that results are always delivered in the correct order. If

// enqueue has not been called before, then it is important to

// call invoke immediately, without waiting on a callback to fire,

// so that the async generator function has the opportunity to do

// any necessary setup in a predictable way. This predictability

// is why the Promise constructor synchronously invokes its

// executor callback, and why async functions synchronously

// execute code before the first await. Since we implement simple

// async functions in terms of async generators, it is especially

// important to get this right, even though it requires care.

// Avoid propagating failures to Promises returned by later

// invocations of the iterator.

// A .throw or .return when the delegate iterator has no .throw

// method always terminates the yield* loop.

// Note: ["return"] must be used for ES3 parsing compatibility.

// If the delegate iterator has a return method, give it a

// chance to clean up.

// If maybeInvokeDelegate(context) changed context.method from

// "return" to "throw", let that override the TypeError below.

// Assign the result of the finished delegate to the temporary

// variable specified by delegate.resultName (see delegateYield).

// Resume execution at the desired location (see delegateYield).

// If context.method was "throw" but the delegate handled the

// exception, let the outer generator proceed normally. If

// context.method was "next", forget context.arg since it has been

// "consumed" by the delegate iterator. If context.method was

// "return", allow the original .return call to continue in the

// outer generator.

// The delegate iterator is finished, so forget it and continue with

// the outer generator.

// Define Generator.prototype.{next,throw,return} in terms of the

// unified ._invoke helper method.

// The root entry object (effectively a try statement without a catch

// or a finally block) gives us a place to store values thrown from

// locations where there is no enclosing try statement.

// Return an iterator with no values.

// Regardless of whether this script is executing as a CommonJS module

// or not, return the runtime object so that we can declare the variable

// regeneratorRuntime in the outer scope, which allows this module to be

// injected easily by `bin/regenerator --include-runtime script.js`.

// For the native GeneratorFunction constructor, the best we can

// do is to check its .name property.

// Within the body of any async function, `await x` is transformed to

// `yield regeneratorRuntime.awrap(x)`, so that the runtime can test

// `hasOwn.call(value, "__await")` to determine if the yielded value is

// meant to be awaited.

// Note that simple async functions are implemented on top of

// AsyncIterator objects; they just return a Promise for the value of

// the final result produced by the iterator.

// A Generator should always return itself as the iterator object when the

// @@iterator function is called on it. Some browsers' implementations of the

// iterator prototype chain incorrectly implement this, causing the Generator

// object to not be returned from this call. This ensures that doesn't happen.

// See https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/issues/274 for more details.

// Rather than returning an object with a next method, we keep

// things simple and return the next function itself.

// To avoid creating an additional object, we just hang the .value

// and .done properties off the next function object itself. This

// also ensures that the minifier will not anonymize the function.

// Resetting context._sent for legacy support of Babel's

// Not sure about the optimal order of these conditions:

// If the dispatched exception was caught by a catch block,

// then let that catch block handle the exception normally.

// Exception thrown outside of any try block that could handle

// it, so set the completion value of the entire function to

// throw the exception.

// Ignore the finally entry if control is not jumping to a

// location outside the try/catch block.

// The context.catch method must only be called with a location

// argument that corresponds to a known catch block.

// Deliberately forget the last sent value so that we don't

// accidentally pass it on to the delegate.

// This module should not be running in strict mode, so the above

// assignment should always work unless something is misconfigured. Just

// in case runtime.js accidentally runs in strict mode, we can escape

// strict mode using a global Function call. This could conceivably fail

// if a Content Security Policy forbids using Function, but in that case

// the proper solution is to fix the accidental strict mode problem. If

// you've misconfigured your bundler to force strict mode and applied a

// CSP to forbid Function, and you're not willing to fix either of those

// problems, please detail your unique predicament in a GitHub issue.
